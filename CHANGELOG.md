## [0.5.0] - 2025-10-24

### Added
- **SQLite Migration (Core Data Store)**
  - Replaced legacy CSV/JSON storage (`database/image_log.csv`, `database/statistics.csv`, `database/users.json`, `database/customization.json`) with a robust SQLite database (`database/app.sqlite3`).
  - New schema:
    - `users` (username, password_hash, role)
    - `settings` (key/value, JSON) â€“ includes `customization`, encrypted API keys, and feature flags
    - `generations` (all image metadata, costs, and a `deleted` flag to preserve billing data)
  - Central PDO layer with WAL, foreign keys, and timeouts for reliability.
  - All endpoints rewritten to use SQLite (auth, customization, upload/list/delete images, private toggle, batch main image, statistics, user stats).
  - Costs are persisted per generation (OpenAI: 3/6/25 + 3 per ref; Gemini: 3 output + 15 per input) and statistics now include deleted images to preserve historical spend.
  - Optional migration script `php/migrate.php` to import existing CSV/JSON into SQLite idempotently. This file will be removed in future versions.
  - Setup flow now seeds admin, customization, and stores API keys encrypted (no .env needed for runtime).

- **Gemini Nano Banana Integration** - AI-powered image editing with Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image:
  - New mode toggle in generation UI to switch between image generation (OpenAI) and image editing (Gemini)
  - Upload 1-2 reference images for AI-powered editing and transformation
  - Gemini API key management in customization settings (admin-only)
  - Automatic cost calculation: 15 cents per input image + 3 cents for output
  - Dynamic thumbnail generation supporting arbitrary aspect ratios from Gemini
  - Full integration with existing gallery, lightbox, and statistics
  - Mode toggle only appears when Gemini API key is configured
  - Seamless workflow: upload images, describe desired changes, get edited results
  - Complete i18n support with English and German translations
- Image streaming for 1-image generations. Users will see partial images during generation
- Reference image storage and display in lightbox:
  - Reference images used during generation are now automatically saved on the server
  - Reference images are stored per batch in `images/refs/<batchId>` directory
  - Lightbox displays reference image thumbnails for images that were generated with references
  - Reference images are only visible to the image owner (or administrators)
  - Thumbnails are hidden by default and can be toggled via clickable label with tooltip
  - Clicking on a reference thumbnail opens it in a new tab
  - Reference images are automatically deleted when the associated batch is removed
